# WritingLibraries
This is the LyX source code for the article on [writing Arduino and AVR libraries](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/WritingLibraries). The demo libraries can be found in my [digitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/digitalPin) and [avrDigitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/avrDigitalPin) repositories.
